# LinkedIn Auto Scraper

LinkedIn Auto Scraper is a command-line application designed to scrape cleaned information from LinkedIn profiles based on job titles and locations. The app offers two main commands: `login` and `scrape`. Once you've logged in using the `login` command, you can perform continuous scraping without the need to log in again, thanks to the authentication caching feature.

### Scrape

bash

`linkedin-auto-scraper scrape` 

By default, the app will search for profiles related to the HR field. You can customize the search by using the following options:

-   `--search` (`-s`): Specify the search parameter (default: "hr").
-   `--location` (`-l`): Use it to search for profiles in a specific location (default: None).
-   `--excel`: This option is required and indicates whether to generate an Excel file with the scraped data (default: no-excel).

Example usage:

bash

`linkedin-auto-scraper scrape --search software engineer --location San Francisco --excel` 

Follow the prompts to enter the desired job title and location. The app will scrape and display cleaned information from LinkedIn profiles matching your criteria.
